# fhir-connector-base

This project should be used to develop the various fhir-connectors in one central place
with the various system implementations in the submodules.

### Build Docker Images

If all git submodules are up to date you can run the 
`./build-docker.sh` Script. It will build and create all Docker Images locally.
